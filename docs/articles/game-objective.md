 
## Game Modes

The game can be played in two different modes: **Team Deathmatch** and **Capture the Flag**.

### Team Deathmatch

In this mode, three or four teams compete against each other. Each team consists of three agents that share the same behavior logic.\
 Each agent has an energy level, which decreases when the agent is tagged by an enemy agent. The first team to deplete the energy \
 levels of all enemy agents wins the game.

### Capture the Flag

This mode features two teams, each with their own base and a team flag located at a flag stand. The goal is to capture the enemy \
teamâ€™s flag and bring it back to their own flag stand, while simultaneously preventing the enemy from stealing your own flag. \
A point is awarded each time a team successfully returns the enemy flag to its base.

The match ends after a fixed number of ticks. Unlike in Team Deathmatch, agents respawn at their base when their energy is depleted, \
allowing continuous play throughout the match duration.
