# LaserTag: A Multi-Agent Simulation Game
**Version 1.0.2** – *Released: June 17, 2025*


LaserTag is an agent-based simulation game designed for developers to implement and test agent behaviors and let agent teams with different strategies compete against each other. The game runs on the multi-agent simulation framework [MARS (Multi-Agent Research and Simulation)](https://mars-group-haw.github.io/index.html).

For game rules, agent interfaces, and further details, refer to the website [Mars Laser Tag Game](https://www.mars-group.org/model-mars-laser-tag-game/).


## Usage

LaserTag is a [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) application. To work with it, open the directory `LaserTagBox/` with a .NET IDE of your choice (e.g., [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

**Note:** The MARS Framework integrates into LaserTag via a [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/) package. If the MARS dependencies of LaserTag are not resolved properly, use the nuget package manager of your IDE to search for and install the nuget package `Mars.Life.Simulations`.

## Visualization

To visualize the results of a simulation, prebuilt [visualization tools](https://github.com/MARS-Group-HAW/mars-grid-visualizer/releases) are provided for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### How to Use

1. Go to the directory `Visualization/`.
2. Choose the release corresponding to your operating system:
   - `visualization_windows.zip` for Windows
   - `visualization_macOS.app.tar.xz` for macOS
   - `visualization_linux.zip` for Linux
3. Extract the archive in the directory.
4. Run the extracted application 
   - On Windows: `visualization.exe`
   - On Linux: `visualization.sh`.
   - On macOS:  
     ```bash
     ./visualization_macOS.app/Contents/MacOS/mars-grid-visualizer
     ```


The visualization reads game data produced during a simulation and displays it in a graphical interface.



### Note

The visualization was created using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). No installation is required – the exported version runs as a standalone application.

### macOS Gatekeeper Warning

macOS may block the visualization app when it's downloaded from the internet.  
If you encounter a warning that the app is from an "unidentified developer", you can allow it manually:

- Right-click the application and select “Open”.
- Confirm the dialog when prompted.

This will add an exception and allow future starts.

### Alternative: Use Analysis Tool

If the graphical visualization does not work on your system, you can alternatively use the analysis tool described in the [**Analysis**](#analysis) section below. It provides a timeline-based playback of agent movements and interactions using the logged data from the simulation.



### Disabling Visualization
If you do not want to use the visualization, you can disable it in the simulation configuration.

Open your JSON configuration file `config.json` Set the "Visualization" mapping parameter to false like this:
```json
...
"layers": [
  {
    "name": "PlayerBodyLayer",
    "file": "Resources/ctf_Battleground.csv",
    "dimensionx": 51,
    "dimensiony": 51,
    "mapping": [
      {
        "parameter": "Visualization",
        "value": false
      }
    ]
  }
]
...
```

## Game Setup

To set up a LaserTag game, follow these steps:

1. Add your agents' implementation files to the directory `LaserTagBox/Model/Mind/`.

2. In the file `LaserTagBox/Program.cs`, add the following line per agent type:

   ```csharp
   description.AddAgent<MyAgentType, PlayerMindLayer>();
   ```

   **Note:** `MyAgentType` is the name of the main class of your agent type.

3. In the file `LaserTagBox/Program.cs`, specify a JSON configuration file for the simulation.

   ```csharp
   var file = File.ReadAllText("my_config_file.json");
   ```

   **Note:** `my_config_file` is the name of the JSON file that contains the game configuration.

   **Note:** The game is designed to be played by two, three of four teams. If fewer teams are specified in the file `Program.cs`, the remaining teams are placed in the game as "empty" agents without behavioral logic.

   **Note:** The default configuration files for three-player and four-player games (`config_3.json` and `config_4.json`, respectively) can be found in the directory `LaserTagBox/`.

4. In the configuration file, specify the map for the game.

   ```json
   ...
   "layers": [{
     ...
     "file": my_map.csv,
     ...
   }],
   ...
   ```

   **Note:** `my_map` is the name of the CSV file that contains the map encoding.

   In the directory `LaserTagBox/Resources/`, there are some default maps. You can generate your own maps using the following encoding:

   - 0 = empty cell (accessible)
   - 1 = `Barrier` (inaccessible)
   - 2 = `Hill` (accessible)
   - 3 = `Ditch` (accessible)
   - 4 = `Water` (inaccessible)
   - 5 = `ExplosiveBarrel` (inaccessible)
   - 7 = `FlagStand (red)` (accessible)
   - 8 = `FlagStand (yellow)` (accessible)

5. Run `Program.cs`.
6. If you have enabled the visualization in your configuration file (i.e., `"Visualization": true`), run the corresponding executable as described in the [Visualization](#visualization) section after the simulation starts.

   This will allow you to observe the simulation in real time.


## Analysis

After the simulation has finished, you can analyze the agents’ behavior using the analysis tool.

1. Go to the directory `Analysis/`.
2. Run the file `vis.py`. You can either double-click the file or execute it via terminal:

   ```bash
   python3 vis.py
   ```

    This tool allows you to replay the movements and interactions of all agents step by step based on the simulation log data. It is especially useful as a fallback if the visualization application is not available or cannot be run due to technical limitations.
